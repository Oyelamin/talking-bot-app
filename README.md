# Robot Speaker App

## Project Overview
The **Robot Speaker App** is an Android application built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. The app demonstrates the use of the **Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine** to allow a robot avatar to "speak" a predefined phrase when tapped. This project was implemented for the IFT 310 (Mobile App Development) assessment.

## Features
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:** Converts predefined text into spoken audio using Android’s `TextToSpeech` engine.
- **Jetpack Compose UI:** Modern declarative UI for a responsive and interactive interface.
- **Robot Avatar Interaction:** Tap on the robot image to trigger speech output.
- **Status Updates:** Displays real-time status messages such as TTS initialization, speaking state, and errors.
- **Audio Management:** Checks media volume before speaking and provides warnings if volume is muted.
- **TTS Engine Compatibility:** Supports both legacy and modern TTS APIs based on the device’s Android version.
